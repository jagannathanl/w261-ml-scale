    "> __a)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> Hadoop MapReduce paradigm is based out of the following 3 concepts: (1) Functional Programming, (2) Mappers and Reducers, and (3) Execution Framework as discussed in Lin and Dyer book, chapter 2 MapReduce Basics. </span>  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> After the Map phase and before the beginning of the Reduce phase there is a handoff process, known as shuffle and sort. Shuffle and sort steo performs the important tasks of routing, collating records with the same key, and transporting these records from the mapper is prepared and moved to the nodes where the reducer tasks are run. This step can become potentially expensive as the data is transported through the networking layer and also because same keys can be emitted several times by the mappers and if they were not consolidated will take up the network bandwidht unnecessarily. To improve overall efficiency, records from mapper output are sent to the physical node that a reducer will be running on as they are being produced - to avoid flooding the network when all mapper tasks are complete. Combiners can be used to consolidate the records with the same key to a minimum so that they dont flood the network. So, combiners that allow for local aggregation can serve as a optimization step in MapReduce. MapReduce does not use combiners in default.</span>   \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> In any MapReduce program, the reducer input key-value type must match the mapper output key-value type: this implies that the combiner input and output key-value types must match the mapper output key-value type (which is the same as the reducer input key-value type). As mentioned above, combiner is an optional component so when we write reducers that are compatible to the combiner will break when the combiners were not used by the framework. So, it is necessary to match the input and output record format of the combiner.</span>  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> Unlike with a traditional HPC job, the level of parallelism in a Hadoop job is adjustable. The number of map tasks is ultimately determined by the nature of your input data due to how HDFS distributes chunks of data to your mappers. Similarly, number of reducers is determined by the scale of the data and desired time to complete the processing. With Hadoop, we can \"suggest\" a number of mappers and reducers  when wesubmit the job. The following are the parameters that we typically pass to the Hadoop at the command line to control the number of mappers and reducers: \"-D mapred.map.tasks=4\", \"-D mapred.job.reducers=4\"  </span> \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\">The manner in which the semiconductor industry had been exploiting Moore’s Law simply ran out of opportunities for improvement: faster clocks, deeper pipelines, superscalar architectures, and other tricks of the trade reached a point of diminishing returns that did not justify continued investment. As a result, the performance of new generated CPUs didn't dramatically increase as it did in the past. This marked the beginning ofan entirely new strategy and the dawn of the multi-core era. In this backdrop, widespread need for data-intensive processing, flooding of commodity computing platforms and the plummeeting storage costs drove innovations in distributed computing such as MapReduce—first by Google, and then by Yahoo and the open source community. This in turn created more demand: when organizations learned about the availability of effective data analysis tools for large datasets, they began instrumenting various business processes to gather even more data—driven by the belief that more data leads to deeper insights and greater competitive advantages.<span>"

    "\n",
    "> __b)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> Composite keys are keys that are made up of two or more number of fields that can be used for sequencing or ordering records. By emitting appropriate values for these keys we can control the flow of data in the sort and shuffle part of the MapReduce framework. But if we used multiple reducers, a default partitionerwould use the CompositeKey and would assign it to a reducer. This would “randomly” partition keys. With a custom partitioner, we will be able to control the flow by grouping (key1, key2, ...,value) tuples with  same “state” and send it to a same reducer. (IOT sensor data, ..)</span>  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\">The order inversion pattern exploits the sorting phase of MapReduce to push data needed for calculations to the reducer ahead of the data that will be manipulated. Often, a reducer needs to compute an aggregate statistic on a set of elements before individual elements can be processed. Normally, this would require two passes over the data, but with the “order inversion” design pattern, the aggregate statistic can be computed in the reducer before the individual elements are encountered. We can add some special characters to the key such that it gets sorted ahead of other elements in the list.</span>\n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",

    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results.

    "# Question 4:  Enron Ham/Spam EDA.\n",
    "Before building our classifier, lets get aquainted with our data. In particular, we're interested in which words occur more in spam emails than in legitimate (\"ham\") emails. In this question you'll implement two Hadoop MapReduce jobs to count and sort word occurrences by document class. You'll also learn about two new Hadoop streaming parameters that will allow you to control how the records output from your mappers are partitioned for reducing on separate nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`IMPORTANT NOTE:`__ For this question and all subsequent items, you should include both the subject and the body of the email in your analysis (i.e. concatetate them to get the 'text' of the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) code:__ Complete the missing components of the code in __`EnronEDA/mapper.py`__ and __`EnronEDA/reducer.py`__ to create a Hadoop  MapReduce job that counts how many times each word in the corpus occurs in an email for each class. Pay close attention to the data format specified in the docstrings of these scripts _-- there are a number of ways to accomplish this task, we've chosen this format to help illustrate a technique in `part e`_. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your code works as expected, then run the provided Hadoop Streaming command to apply your analysis to the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) code + short response:__ How many times does the word \"__assistance__\" occur in each class? (`HINT:` Use a `grep` command to read from the results file you generated in '`a`' and then report the answer in the space provided.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Would it have been possible to add some sorting parameters to the Hadoop streaming command that would cause our `part a` results to be sorted by count? Explain why or why not. (`HINT:` This question demands an understanding of the sequence of the phases of MapReduce.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code + short response:__ Write a second Hadoop MapReduce job to sort the output of `part a` first by class and then by count. Run your job and save the results to a local file. Then describe in words how you would go about printing the top 10 words in each class given this sorted output. (`HINT 1:` _remember that you can simply pass the `part a` output directory to the input field of this job; `HINT 2:` since this task is just reodering the records from `part a` we don't need to write a mapper or reducer, just use `/bin/cat` for both_)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ A more efficient alternative to '`grep`-ing' for the top 10 words in each class would be to use the Hadoop framework to separate records from each class into its own partition so that we can just read the top lines in each. Rewrite your job from ` part d` to specify 2 reduce tasks and to tell Hadoop to partition based on the second field (which indicates spam/ham in our data). Your code should maintain the secondary sort -- that is each partition should list words from most to least frequent."

    "> __b)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> The word assistance appeared 8 times in the class \"spam\" and appeared 2 times in the class \"ham\"</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> Yes, it is possible to sort by streaming the data in hadopp by using the unix cat command as the mapper and reducer and exploiting the default shuffle as Hadoop sorts the numeric value by default. ???</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ <span style=\"font-family:Verdana; color: green;\"> This question has two parts to it. (1) Sorting the output fro part a: The output from part a has 3 fields per record (word, class, count). We can then stream the output through Hadoop using unix /bin/cat and configuring the shuffle and sort layer to sort by the primary key the class and secondary key the count to accomplish the sorting. (Pleae look the code at the cell dedicated for this section below) (2) How to list top 10 items in each class: As we partitioned the data by the class. The reducer output from reducer 1 and reducer 2 will be in hdfs output directory in part 1 and part 2 respectively. We can pipe the \"!hdfs dfs -cat\" to unix \"head\" to peek at the top 10 items from each partition sequentially.</span>  "

Doing so successfully requires a thorough understanding of the data size at each stage of the job.

    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",

This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",

    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",

To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not. From a scability perspective when would this kind of memory use be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",

[`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",

    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "# Question 8: Naive Bayes Training.\n",
    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace smoothing (where the smoothing parameter $k=1$) makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",

How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set.
